<p><b>About me:</b><br>
  I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a <br>
  minor in Mathematical Sciences. I have five years of experience with <br>
  programming which consisted of java throughout high school, and c and c++ at <br>
  the college level. Through this, I have good knowledge of object-oriented <br>
  programming as well as various data structures and their implementations. I <br>
  also have experience with swift and iOS development and I am currently working <br>
  on publishing apps to the app store</p>
