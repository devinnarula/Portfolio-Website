<a href=https://github.com/devinnarula/alexa-hello-world><b>Clemson Canvas Alexa Skill</b></a>
</p>
<p>I created this skill for an Amazon Alexa with a team of three others. It can <br>
  access Canvas, the service Clemson uses for assignments, to read the user <br>
  their upcoming assignments. It won best hardware hack in the 2019 HelloWorld <br>
  Hackathon event at Clemson University.</p>

<a href=https://github.com/devinnarula/Puddle-iOS-Application><b>Puddle iOS Application</b></a>
</p>
<p>This application was created in a team with three others. It functions as a <br>
  pedestrian map application to alert people of obstacles in the area such as <br>
  puddles. My role was to create the interface of the app while the other group <br>
  members worked on the backend configurations. It won best use of Radar.io in <br>
  the 2019 CUhackit hackathon event at Clemson University.</p>
