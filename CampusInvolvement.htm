<p>The role is a place for freshmen to serve in Clemson student government <br>
  which often leads to future leadership roles at the university.  I am on the <br>
  community service committee where we organize and run service projects on <br>
  campus.</p>

<p>I served as a senator for four months on the innovation and technology <br>
  committee. My primary roles were to vote on legislation and create a project <br>
  which would allow more access to charging technologies for computers and <br>
  phones on campus. I am currently continuing this project as a part of ITSAB.</p>

<p>ITSAB is a board where a group of students are given the opportunity to work <br>
  with administrators and CCIT executives regarding IT related issues as well <br>
  as allocate funding for technology related projects. My role was to advise <br>
  the IT trajectory of the university from a student perspective as well as to <br>
  aide in the allocation of this funding.</p>
